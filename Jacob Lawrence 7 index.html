    <p>Jacob Lawrence painted the seminal series about the Great Migration. This series details the lives of African Americans traveling from the South to North. It is a vital record of American history. The series is made up of 60 pieces split evenly between The Phillips Collection in DC and MOMA in NY. He detailed the experiences of the people in the epic move with caesin tempera paint on hardboard. He was also a WPA artist. </p>

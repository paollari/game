    <h1>1.) Who painted this?</h1>
    <p> Answer: Alma Thomas</p>
    <p> Alma Thomas was a ground breaker. She was not only one of the first African American women to have graduated with an art degree but the first to graduate from Howard Universities Fine Art program. During her classes at American University she learnt about the Color Field Movement, which was prominant in there. Her work has hung in the White House.</p>
